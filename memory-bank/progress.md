- **Admin Dashboard**: HIGH - Admin interface for managing registrations
- **Database Schema**: HIGH - User and registration data models
- **API Endpoints**: HIGH - Registration, authentication, and admin APIs
- **Authentication System**: HIGH - Login, logout, and session management
- **Server-side Validation**: MEDIUM - Complete server-side validation
- **Email Notifications**: MEDIUM - Registration confirmation emails
- **Testing Suite**: MEDIUM - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Deployment Configuration**: LOW - Production deployment setup
- **Documentation**: LOW - User and admin documentation

## Recent Achievements (2025-01-27)
- **Enhanced Form Validation**: Implemented dynamic required validation for conditional fields
- **Thai Phone Number Validation**: Added proper validation and formatting for Thai phone numbers
- **Visual UX Improvements**: Implemented consistent validation cues across all form fields
- **Progress Calculation Fix**: Fixed progress logic to only count relevant conditional fields
- **Image Preview Enhancement**: Improved upload field previews with responsive sizing
- **Conditional Field Logic**: Proper handling of roommate and business type fields
- **Code Quality**: Fixed ESLint warnings and improved code organization

## Known Issues
- **Database Not Configured**: CRITICAL - No database connection established
- **Missing API Routes**: HIGH - No backend functionality implemented
- **No Authentication**: HIGH - No user authentication system
- **No Testing**: MEDIUM - No test framework configured
