## What's In Progress
- **Database Setup**: 0% - Need to configure database and Prisma ORM
- **API Development**: 0% - API routes need to be implemented
- **Authentication System**: 0% - JWT authentication needs to be built
- **User Interface**: 0% - Registration forms and components need to be created

## What's Left To Build
- **Registration Form Implementation**: HIGH - Complete the actual form fields and functionality
- **Preview Page**: HIGH - Page to review registration data before submission
- **Admin Dashboard**: HIGH - Admin interface for managing registrations
- **Database Schema**: HIGH - User and registration data models
- **API Endpoints**: HIGH - Registration, authentication, and admin APIs
- **Authentication System**: HIGH - Login, logout, and session management
- **Form Validation**: MEDIUM - Complete client and server-side validation
- **Email Notifications**: MEDIUM - Registration confirmation emails
- **Testing Suite**: MEDIUM - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Deployment Configuration**: LOW - Production deployment setup
- **Documentation**: LOW - User and admin documentation

## Known Issues
- **Database Not Configured**: CRITICAL - No database connection established
- **Missing API Routes**: HIGH - No backend functionality implemented
- **No Authentication**: HIGH - No user authentication system
- **Registration Form Not Implemented**: HIGH - Form placeholder exists but no actual form fields
- **No Testing**: MEDIUM - No test framework configured
