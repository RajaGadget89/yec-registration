# Active Context: YEC Registration System
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-01-27*
*Last Updated: 2025-01-27*
*Current RIPER Mode: INITIALIZING*

## Current Focus
Project initialization and setup phase. The START phase has been completed successfully, establishing the foundation for the YEC Registration System.

## Recent Changes
- **2025-01-27**: Project initialization started with START phase
- **2025-01-27**: Requirements gathered and documented in projectbrief.md
- **2025-01-27**: Technology stack selected and documented in techContext.md
- **2025-01-27**: System architecture defined in systemPatterns.md
- **2025-01-27**: Project scaffolding completed with folder structure and utility files
- **2025-01-27**: Development environment configured with Docker and dependencies
- **2025-01-27**: Memory bank initialized with all core documentation files

## Active Decisions
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL recommended for production, SQLite for development
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database access
- **Testing**: Jest and Playwright for comprehensive testing
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with Vercel deployment option

## Next Steps
1. Transition to RESEARCH mode to analyze existing codebase
2. Identify specific implementation requirements for registration forms
3. Plan database schema and API endpoints
4. Design user interface components
5. Implement core registration functionality

## Current Challenges
- **Database Setup**: Need to configure PostgreSQL or SQLite database
- **Authentication System**: Implement JWT-based authentication
- **Form Validation**: Complete client and server-side validation
- **Admin Dashboard**: Design and implement admin interface
- **Testing Framework**: Set up comprehensive testing suite

## Implementation Progress
- [✓] Project initialization and setup
- [✓] Technology stack selection
- [✓] Architecture definition
- [✓] Development environment configuration
- [✓] Memory bank creation
- [ ] Database schema design
- [ ] API endpoint implementation
- [ ] User registration form
- [ ] Admin dashboard
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Testing implementation

## Immediate Priorities
1. Complete START phase transition to DEVELOPMENT phase
2. Enter RESEARCH mode to analyze current state
3. Begin planning specific implementation details
4. Set up database and basic API structure
