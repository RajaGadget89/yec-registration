# Active Context: YEC Registration System
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-01-27*
*Last Updated: 2025-01-27T13:00:00Z*
*Current RIPER Mode: RESEARCH*

## Current Focus
Registration form implementation completed. All form fields have been implemented with real-time validation, dynamic behavior, and proper styling. The form includes all required fields: file uploads, dropdowns, text inputs, and conditional fields. Ready to proceed with preview page and backend integration.

## Recent Changes
- **2025-01-27**: Project initialization started with START phase
- **2025-01-27**: Requirements gathered and documented in projectbrief.md
- **2025-01-27**: Technology stack selected and documented in techContext.md
- **2025-01-27**: System architecture defined in systemPatterns.md
- **2025-01-27**: Project scaffolding completed with folder structure and utility files
- **2025-01-27**: Development environment configured with Docker and dependencies
- **2025-01-27**: Memory bank initialized with all core documentation files
- **2025-01-27**: Landing page components implemented (TopMenuBar, HeroSection, BannerSection, Footer)
- **2025-01-27**: Registration form implementation completed with all fields and validation

## Active Decisions
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL recommended for production, SQLite for development
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database access
- **Testing**: Jest and Playwright for comprehensive testing
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with Vercel deployment option

## Next Steps
1. Create the preview page for form review
2. Set up database schema and API endpoints
3. Implement server-side validation
4. Add authentication system
5. Create admin dashboard

## Current Challenges
- **Database Setup**: Need to configure PostgreSQL or SQLite database
- **Authentication System**: Implement JWT-based authentication
- **Form Validation**: Complete client and server-side validation
- **Admin Dashboard**: Design and implement admin interface
- **Testing Framework**: Set up comprehensive testing suite

## Implementation Progress
- [✓] Project initialization and setup
- [✓] Technology stack selection
- [✓] Architecture definition
- [✓] Development environment configuration
- [✓] Memory bank creation
- [✓] Landing page components (UI structure)
- [✓] User registration form implementation
- [ ] Database schema design
- [ ] API endpoint implementation
- [ ] Preview page creation
- [ ] Admin dashboard
- [ ] Authentication system

## Immediate Priorities
1. Create the preview page for form review
2. Set up database and basic API structure
3. Implement server-side validation
4. Begin planning admin dashboard implementation
