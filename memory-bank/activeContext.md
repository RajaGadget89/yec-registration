# Active Context: YEC Registration System
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-01-27*
*Last Updated: 2025-01-27T12:30:00Z*
*Current RIPER Mode: RESEARCH*

## Current Focus
Landing page development completed. All core UI components have been implemented including TopMenuBar, HeroSection, BannerSection, RegistrationForm placeholder, and Footer. Ready to proceed with actual form implementation and backend integration.

## Recent Changes
- **2025-01-27**: Project initialization started with START phase
- **2025-01-27**: Requirements gathered and documented in projectbrief.md
- **2025-01-27**: Technology stack selected and documented in techContext.md
- **2025-01-27**: System architecture defined in systemPatterns.md
- **2025-01-27**: Project scaffolding completed with folder structure and utility files
- **2025-01-27**: Development environment configured with Docker and dependencies
- **2025-01-27**: Memory bank initialized with all core documentation files
- **2025-01-27**: Landing page components implemented (TopMenuBar, HeroSection, BannerSection, RegistrationForm placeholder, Footer)

## Active Decisions
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL recommended for production, SQLite for development
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database access
- **Testing**: Jest and Playwright for comprehensive testing
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with Vercel deployment option

## Next Steps
1. Implement the actual registration form fields and functionality
2. Create the preview page for form review
3. Plan database schema and API endpoints
4. Design user interface components
5. Implement core registration functionality

## Current Challenges
- **Database Setup**: Need to configure PostgreSQL or SQLite database
- **Authentication System**: Implement JWT-based authentication
- **Form Validation**: Complete client and server-side validation
- **Admin Dashboard**: Design and implement admin interface
- **Testing Framework**: Set up comprehensive testing suite

## Implementation Progress
- [✓] Project initialization and setup
