- **Security Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates password storage and transmission risks
  - Time-limited, single-use authentication tokens
  - Automatic session management with secure cookie handling
- **User Experience**: Streamlined login process with email-based authentication
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Supabase Auth integration with custom callback handling
  - Secure cookie configuration with httpOnly, sameSite, and secure flags
  - Automatic token refresh and session validation

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin Roles**: Implemented hierarchical role system (admin, super_admin)
- **Permission Management**: 
  - Super admin: Full system access including user management
  - Admin: Registration management and approval workflows
- **UI Indicators**: Visual role badges with Crown/Shield icons for clear role identification
- **Session Management**: Secure logout with proper cookie cleanup

### Security Audit Trail
- **Event Logging**: All admin actions logged to audit table
- **Action Tracking**: Registration status changes, approvals, rejections, and updates
- **Compliance**: Full audit trail for regulatory and security requirements

## User Experience & Interface Improvements

### Modern UI/UX Design
- **Design System**: Implemented consistent card-modern design pattern with backdrop blur effects

### Interactive Dashboard Components
- **Summary Cards**: Real-time statistics with animated counters and status indicators
- **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-criteria filtering with URL state persistence
  - Status-based filtering (pending, waiting_for_review, approved, rejected)
  - Province-based filtering with multi-select
  - Date range filtering with calendar interface
  - Text search across registration data
- **Data Table**: Sortable columns with visual indicators and pagination
- **Details Drawer**: Slide-out panel for detailed registration information

### Real-time Updates

- **File Naming**: Automatic timestamp-based file naming
- **Data Formatting**: Proper CSV formatting with headers and data sanitization

## Domain Event Architecture

### Event-Driven System Design
- **Centralized Event Bus**: All side-effects handled through domain events
- **Event Types**:
  - `registration.submitted` → `waiting_for_review`
  - `registration.batch_upserted` → `waiting_for_review`
  - `admin.request_update` → `pending`
  - `admin.approved` → `approved`
  - `admin.rejected` → `rejected`

### Event Handlers
- **StatusUpdateHandler**: Database status updates with transaction safety
- **EmailNotificationHandler**: Automated email notifications to registrants
- **TelegramNotificationHandler**: Real-time notifications via Telegram bot
- **AuditLogHandler**: Comprehensive audit trail logging

### System Benefits
- **Decoupling**: API routes focus on request/response, events handle side-effects
- **Scalability**: Event handlers can be scaled independently
- **Reliability**: Idempotent event processing with error isolation
- **Maintainability**: Centralized business logic in dedicated handlers

## Technical Architecture Improvements

### Code Quality Enhancements
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Full type safety with zero compilation errors
- **ESLint Standards**: Clean codebase with no linting warnings
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components with clear interfaces
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient state management and rendering

### API Design
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Consistent API design patterns
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and overload

### Database Integration
- **Supabase Integration**: Real-time database updates with optimistic UI
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- **Data Consistency**: Transaction-based updates ensuring data integrity

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function testing
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint and database interaction testing
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflow testing with Playwright
- **Authentication Tests**: Magic link flow and session management testing
