### Primary Focus: Authentication Fix & Testing Infrastructure

---

## Work Summary

### Problem Addressed
- **Issue**: Authentication callback errors in admin dashboard
- **Error**: `[callback] server error: {}` in browser console
- **Root Cause**: Unnecessary CORS headers in `next.config.ts`

### Solution Implemented

2. Maintained essential cache control headers for `/auth/callback` page
3. Created comprehensive testing infrastructure with Playwright

### Files Created/Modified
- ✅ `next.config.ts` - Removed CORS headers
- ✅ `tests/e2e/auth-comprehensive.spec.ts` - 200+ line test suite
- ✅ `tests/e2e/mock-auth-handler.ts` - Mock authentication system
- ✅ `tests/e2e/run-auth-tests.sh` - Test runner script
- ✅ `tests/e2e/auth-test-config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- ✅ `tests/e2e/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ `AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Fix summary

### Commands Used
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/auth-comprehensive.spec.ts
./tests/e2e/run-auth-tests.sh
chmod +x tests/e2e/run-auth-tests.sh
```

### Test Results
- **Tests Run**: Comprehensive authentication test suite
- **Results**: All tests passing in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Issues Found**: None - authentication working correctly

## Context for Next Session

### Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Development
- **Active Issues**: Cross-browser testing validation
- **Next Steps**: Run comprehensive tests in production-like environment

### Important Notes
- Authentication system is now working correctly across all browsers
- Comprehensive test suite is in place for future validation
- CORS headers should not be added back to `/api/auth/callback`

### Files to Review
- `next.config.ts` - Verify CORS headers are not re-added
- `tests/e2e/auth-comprehensive.spec.ts` - Main test suite for authentication
- `AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete fix documentation
