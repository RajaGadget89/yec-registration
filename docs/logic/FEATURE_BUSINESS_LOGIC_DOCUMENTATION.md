## Business Logic Implementation

### Form Validation Logic

#### Client-Side Validation
```typescript
// Real-time validation with comprehensive error handling
const validateField = (field: string, value: any, formData?: any) => {
  switch (field) {
    case 'phone':
      return /^0[0-9]{9}$|^\+66[0-9]{8}$/.test(value);
    case 'email':
      return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(value);
    case 'lineId':
      return /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/.test(value);
    case 'hotelChoice':
      return ['in-quota', 'out-of-quota'].includes(value);
    case 'travelType':
      return ['private-car', 'van'].includes(value);
    // ... other validations with comprehensive error handling
  }
};
```

#### Server-Side Validation
```typescript
// Comprehensive server-side validation with security checks
const validateRegistration = (data: RegistrationData) => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  // Required field validation with security checks
  const requiredFields = ['title', 'firstName', 'lastName', ...];
  requiredFields.forEach(field => {
    if (!data[field] || data[field].trim() === '') {
      errors.push(`Missing required field: ${field}`);
    }
  });
  
  // Conditional field validation with business logic
  if (data.hotelChoice === 'out-of-quota' && !data.external_hotel_name) {
    errors.push('External hotel name required for out-of-quota choice');
  }
  
  // Security validation for file uploads
  if (data.profileImage && !isValidFileType(data.profileImage)) {
    errors.push('Invalid profile image format');
  }
  
  return errors;
};
```

### Badge Generation Logic

#### Canvas Creation with Error Handling
```typescript
const generateBadge = async (registrationData: RegistrationData) => {
  try {
    // Create canvas with high resolution
    const canvas = createCanvas(1200, 800);
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
    // Set background and branding
    ctx.fillStyle = '#ffffff';
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 1200, 800);
    
    // Add YEC logo with error handling
    try {
      const logo = await loadImage('path/to/yec-logo.png');
      ctx.drawImage(logo, 50, 50, 200, 100);
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Logo loading failed, continuing without logo');
    }
    
    // Add registration information with Thai font support
    ctx.font = '48px NotoSansThai';
    ctx.fillStyle = '#000000';
    ctx.fillText(`${registrationData.firstName} ${registrationData.lastName}`, 300, 150);
    
    // Generate and add QR code with error handling
    try {
      const qrCode = await QRCode.toDataURL(JSON.stringify(registrationData));
      const qrImage = await loadImage(qrCode);
      ctx.drawImage(qrImage, 900, 50, 200, 200);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('QR code generation failed:', error);
      // Continue without QR code
    }
    
    return canvas.toBuffer('image/png');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Badge generation failed:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to generate badge');
  }
};
```

### Email Delivery Logic

#### Email Template with Responsive Design
```typescript
const createEmailTemplate = (registrationData: RegistrationData, badgeUrl: string) => {
  return `
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <style>
          .email-container { 
            max-width: 600px; 
            margin: 0 auto; 
            font-family: 'Noto Sans Thai', Arial, sans-serif;
          }
          .badge-image { 
            max-width: 100%; 
            height: auto; 
            border-radius: 8px;
            box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
          }
          .download-button {
            display: inline-block;
            padding: 12px 24px;
            background: #1E40AF;
            color: white;
            text-decoration: none;
            border-radius: 6px;
            margin: 16px 0;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div class="email-container">
          <h1>ยินดีต้อนรับสู่ YEC Day!</h1>
          <p>ขอบคุณสำหรับการลงทะเบียน ${registrationData.firstName} ${registrationData.lastName}</p>
          <p>หมายเลขการลงทะเบียน: ${registrationData.registrationId}</p>
          <img src="${badgeUrl}" alt="YEC Badge" class="badge-image">
          <p>คุณสามารถดาวน์โหลดบัตรประจำตัวได้จากลิงก์ด้านล่าง</p>
          <a href="${badgeUrl}" download class="download-button">ดาวน์โหลดบัตรประจำตัว</a>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
  `;
};
```

### Audit Logging Logic

#### Dual-layer Audit Logging
```typescript
// Access log logging
const logAccessEvent = async (requestData: AccessLogData) => {
  try {
    const { request_id, user_id, email, action, resource, method, path, status_code, request_data, response_data, ip_address, user_agent } = requestData;
    
    await supabase
      .from('audit_access_logs')
      .insert({
        request_id,
        user_id,
        email,
        action,
        resource,
        method,
        path,
        status_code,
        request_data,
        response_data,
        ip_address,
        user_agent
      });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to log access event:', error);
  }
};

// Business event logging
const logBusinessEvent = async (eventData: BusinessEventData) => {
  try {
    const { event_id, event_type, user_id, email, action, resource, resource_id, event_data, metadata } = eventData;
    
    await supabase
      .from('audit_event_logs')
      .insert({
        event_id,
        event_type,
        user_id,
        email,
        action,
        resource,
        resource_id,
        event_data,
        metadata
      });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to log business event:', error);
  }
};
```

### Admin User Management Logic

#### User Creation with Multiple Methods
```typescript
// Environment variable method
const createAdminFromEnvironment = async () => {
  const adminEmails = process.env.ADMIN_EMAILS?.split(',').map(e => e.trim().toLowerCase()).filter(Boolean) || [];
  
  for (const email of adminEmails) {
    try {
      // Create user in Supabase Auth
      const { data: newUser, error: createError } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
        email,
        password: generateTemporaryPassword(),
        email_confirm: true,
      });

      if (newUser.user) {
        // Add to admin_users table
        await upsertAdminUser({
          id: newUser.user.id,
          email: newUser.user.email!,
          role: 'admin',
        });
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to create admin user ${email}:`, error);
    }
  }
};

// Direct API method
const createAdminViaAPI = async (email: string, role: 'admin' | 'super_admin') => {
  try {
    // Validate user permissions
    if (!await hasRole('super_admin')) {
      throw new Error('Insufficient permissions');
    }
    
    // Create user in Supabase Auth
    const { data: newUser, error: createError } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
      email,
      password: generateTemporaryPassword(),
      email_confirm: true,
    });

    if (newUser.user) {
      // Add to admin_users table
      await upsertAdminUser({
        id: newUser.user.id,
        email: newUser.user.email!,
        role,
      });
      
      // Send welcome email
      await sendWelcomeEmail(email, role);
      
      // Log in audit trail
      await logBusinessEvent({
        event_id: generateEventId(),
        event_type: 'admin_user_created',
        user_id: currentUser.id,
        email: currentUser.email,
        action: 'create_admin_user',
        resource: 'admin_users',
        resource_id: newUser.user.id,
        event_data: { email, role },
        metadata: { method: 'api' }
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create admin user via API:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Common Error Scenarios

#### File Upload Errors
- **File Too Large**: Show size limit message with retry option
- **Invalid File Type**: Display supported formats with examples
- **Upload Failure**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Network Issues**: Offline handling and retry with user feedback

#### Badge Generation Errors
- **Canvas Creation Failure**: Fallback to text-only badge with error logging
- **Image Processing Error**: Skip profile photo with graceful degradation
- **QR Code Generation Failure**: Use registration ID only with error handling
- **Storage Upload Failure**: Retry with exponential backoff and user notification

#### Email Delivery Errors
- **Invalid Email Address**: Validation before sending with user feedback
- **Service Unavailable**: Queue for retry with status tracking
